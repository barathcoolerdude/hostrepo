<h2 class="orange"> Something about me</h2>

<p class="about"><b>Welcome to my page<i id="greetings"></i>.</b> 
    
    Hello! I’m Barath Ela, a dedicated software developer with a passion for creating reliable, maintainable, and scalable software solutions. My journey began in college, where I first delved into the world of website and app development. Since then, I’ve broadened my expertise across various fields, including DevOps, data analysis, data engineering, and website development.
    <br><br>
    Driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to find my true calling, I have allowed myself to explore diverse areas within software development. This journey has shaped my commitment to building software that not only works seamlessly but also requires less computational power, ensuring efficiency and sustainability.
    <br><br>
    I firmly believe that there is no life without change, and I am always willing to learn and adapt to become a better version of myself. Embracing new challenges and continuously evolving is at the heart of my professional philosophy, enabling me to craft innovative solutions that stand the test of time and adapt to the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

    <h2 class="antiquewhite">Fun fact</h2>

    <p class="about">Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm passionate about long-distance running, a pursuit that has become my comfort and way of life. I've proudly completed 10K and 12.5K mini marathons on mountainous terrains, finding joy in both the challenge and the breathtaking views.

        <br><br>Running isn't just about competition for me; it's my solace. Each stride brings clarity and connection, pushing me toward growth and self-discovery. I strive to live courageously, facing fears head-on and not letting them dictate my actions.
