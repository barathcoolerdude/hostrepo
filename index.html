<h2 class="orange"> Something about me</h2>

<p><b>welcome to my page.</b> i am Barath Ela. i know we are strangers but you will get to know me here.I'm [Your Name], and I'm interested in a few things: staying active, following current events (especially political news, geopolitics, and business case studies!), and whipping up delicious South Indian food.

    While I might not always be at the gym, I recently completed a 12.5k mini marathon, which I'm pretty proud of!  I'm also constantly learning and expanding my knowledge about the world.
    
    In the kitchen, South Indian cuisine is my specialty. From mastering the perfect dosa to creating flavorful curries, I love exploring the vibrant flavors and traditions of this regional food.
    
    This webpage is a reflection of my passions and a work in progress, just like me!  Feel free to browse around, learn a little something new, and maybe even get inspired to try a South Indian recipe or two.
    
    I'm always looking to connect with others who share similar interests, so don't hesitate to leave a comment or reach out!</p>
